## Introduction
Sometimes I used AngularJS on simple and small project as an elegant way to manipulate DOM elements. One area where I abuse angularjs is when adding additional inputs in the form. 
For example you display an input field where a user can type his contact number and you also want to give him an option of adding his other contact numbers.   

## Problem
You want a button in the form to add additional input when clicked. 

## Solution
[Check the full code](){:.btn.btn-primary.mr10} [download code](#){:.btn.btn-primary.mr10} [view on github](#){:.btn.btn-primary}

The idea is to have a fake data/model in the controller. Then we will use that data to populate a set of input field and remove button in the form using ```ng-repeat```. We will create a function that will add a new item in the model and call it using ```ng-click``` which was attached in the add button. There's also a function to remove an item in the model. This remove function will be triggered when clicking the remove button and it will also accept one parameter which is the ```$index``` of the item generated by the ```ng-repeat```. This parameter allows the remove function to know which item in the model are we deleting. 

So let's start.

### 1. Create a form with one input and a submit button
~~~ html
<form>
    <div class="wrapper">
    	<a href="#" id="addField">Add One Field</a>
    	<p>
    	    <input type="text" class="form-control" name="contact[]" />
    	    <a href="#" class="removeField">Remove</a>
    	</p>
    	<p><input type="submit" value="Submit" /></p>
	</div>
</form>
~~~
This is a very simple form consists of:
- the `form` element
- an outer ```<div>``` to wrap our form elements
- an ```<a>``` tag where we will bind the "addContactField" function
- input field wrapped in a ```<p>``` tag. 
- an ```<a>``` to remove the input field
- a submit button

### 2. Include AngularJS and setup the form for Angular Magic
Include angularjs in your page.

~~~ html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/angular.js"></script>
~~~

Initializes AngularJS by adding ```ng-app="contactsApp"``` in wrapper div.

~~~ html
<form ng-app="contactsApp">  
~~~ 

You can learn more about initializing angularjs [here](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/bootstrap)

Next create a controller called ```CreateContactCtrl``` and declare it in the wrapper div.

~~~ html 
<div class="wrapper" ng-controller="CreateContactCtrl">
~~~ 

### 3. Create the AngularJS script and initialize AngularJS   

~~~ javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
    var app = angular.module('contactsApp', []);
    app.controller('CreateContactCtrl', function($scope) {
        $scope.contacts = [{type: 'text'}];

        $scope.addContactField = function(){
            $scope.contacts.push({type: 'text'});  
        };

        $scope.removeContactField = function(index){ 
            $scope.contacts.splice( index, 1 );
        };
    }); 
</script>
~~~ 

- First we created a ```script``` tag.
- Then we bootstrapped our AngularJS application by passing the ```ng-app``` value declared in the form element
- We add a ```CreateContactCtrl``` controller to our application
- Inside our controller scope, we created 2 methods and 1 property:
 - ```$scope.contacts``` - this is our fake data. The length of this array will determine number of displayed input fields in our form
 - ```$scope.addContactField``` - this function will add an item to ```$scope.contacts```
 - ```$scope.removeContactField``` - this will remove an item on ```$scope.contacts``` 

### 4. Bind the functions to the form
Let's use ```$scope.contacts``` to control the display of input tags. We will use AngularJS directive called ```ng-repeat``` in the ```<p>``` tag that wraps the input field.

~~~ html
<p ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
    <input type="text" class="form-control" name="contact[]" />
    <a href="#" class="removeField">Remove</a>
</p>
~~~ 

By default there is 1 item in our ```$scope.contacts``` because we want to display one set of input field and remove link. You might also wondering about this ```{type: 'text'}``` inside the ```$scope.contacts```, this is also a fake property and it could be something else. The idea is we need to have something inside ```$scope.contacts```. You can also leave it as an empty object if you don't want to display any input field by default.

Now it's time to bind ```addContactField``` and ```removeContactField``` to their respective elements (```#addField``` and ```.removeField```) using an AngularJS directive called ```ng-click```.

~~~ html
<a href="#" id="addField" ng-click="addContactField()">Add One Field</a>
~~~ 

~~~ html 
<a href="#" class="removeField" ng-click="removeContactField($index)">Remove</a>
~~~ 

The ```$index``` passed in ```removeContactField($index)``` is an index generated by ```ng-repeat``` while looping. We will pass the index so ```$scope.removeContactField()``` knows what item in the ```$scope.contacts``` to remove.
